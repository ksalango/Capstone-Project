## Introduction

### Background
Accurate swell forecasts are crucial for coastal management, safety, and recreational activities. The idea for this project originated after the discontinuation of Magic Seaweed in 2022, an online surf forecast platform known for its accuracy. With Surfline now being the predominant surf forecasting website, there remains a need for more precise and locally tailored forecasts for specific regions such as Tofino, BC, Canada.

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop an accurate and reliable surf forecast for Tofino, BC, using historical buoy data and hindcast model data through machine learning methods. By leveraging these data sources, the goal is to create a forecasting model that surpasses the accuracy of existing forecasts provided by Surfline for this area.

### Scope and Objectives
The initial phase of the project focuses on forecasting wave height and wave period, two key components of surf forecasting. The primary objective is to build a predictive model (or set of models) capable of forecasting these elements within a specified error margin, thus improving upon current benchmarks. Additionally, the project aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between wave height and wave period to enhance forecasting methodologies.

### Significance
This research not only seeks to improve surf forecasts for the local community but also contributes to broader coastal management efforts. Accurate forecasts can aid in safety measures, inform recreational activities, and provide insights for future developments in wave prediction models.


 
 ## The methodology is divided into the following key steps:
This is a high level overview of the methodology used in this project. More detailed methodologies are outlined at the beginning of each notebook. 
1. **Setting Benchmarks for Error Range:**
   - The benchmark of 2 feet or 0.60 meters, was decided for wave height.The benchmark range for error in wave height was decided based upon sufline's current daily forecasts that are given within a usual range of 2 feet.
   - The benchmark of 3 seconds was decided for wave period.  The benchmark for wave period was decided based on research into wave period length differentiation based on wind swell or ground swell. Generally wind swell shows wave periods of 1 to about 10 seconds, 10 to about 20 seconds is recognized as ground swell. The difference of 3 seconds is not generally indicative of a change from wind swell to ground swell.
2. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather hindcast data, representing historical wave conditions.
   - Collected historical buoy data.
   - Data was requested from Oceans and Fishers Cananda.

3. **Create a Combined Working Data Frame:**
   - Convert data where necessary into workable format for analysis.
   - Clean buoy data, and deal with error flags.
   - Assess Hindcast Data.
   - Combine data, a total of 28 years of data is obtained: 1988-2016.

3. **Data Processing and EDA:**
   - Clean and explore working dataframe.
   - Look at Distributions of features.
   - Look at relationships between features.
   - Preprocess data for Time Series Modelling:
      - A general dataframe is created for Time Series modelling.
      - Based on modelling approach data is reorganized and feature engineering is done.
      - Additional relevant features are incorportated.
      
4. **Baseline and Model Development:**
   - This project focuses on different methods for forecasting and all methods are compared and contrasted.
   - This project focuses on Supervised Machine Learning:
     - Baseline models: Univariate traditional time series; ARIMA, Linear Regression for multivariate time series.
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost 
     - Vector Auto Regression and Neural Networks (Still in Development)

5. **Model Testing and Iteration:**
   - The same time series train test split is maintained throughout the project: 
      - split point defined as: '2006-01-01'
      - 1988-01-01 to split point defined as train.
      - split point to 2016-01-01 is defined as test.
   - Iteratively refine the model(s) based on testing outcomes, incorporating feedback and insights.
   - Feature Engineer.
    
6. **Develop Live Forecasting** 
   - This part of the project is still in development.
