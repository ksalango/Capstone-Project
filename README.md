## Introduction
Welcome to my Wave Power Predictor project, this project stemms my three-month journey through the BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp. This project seeks to leverage the power of machine learning to forecast wave power at a specific location. Unlike computationally intensive numerical and physics-based models, machine learning offers a potentially more efficient approach.

The foundation of this project lies in training the model with hindcast data derived from a numerical model. Subsequently, rigorous testing will be conducted using historical data collected from the target area. Looking ahead, the prospect of incorporating real-time data opens the door to forecasting wave power with even greater precision.

The overarching objective is to deliver a prediction model that is accurate as well as robust, addressing a specific location's unique dynamics. The potential applications span from contributing to renewable energy research to serving the interests of avid surf enthusiasts.

 
 ## The methodology is divided into the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather hindcast data, representing historical wave conditions.
   - Collected additional historical data for testing and validation.

2. **Hindcast Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the hindcast dataset.
   - Explored temporal patterns and key features influencing wave power.

3. **Baseline Model Development:**
   - Build and train a baseline machine learning model, incorporating time series analysis techniques.
   - Utilize the hindcast data to establish an initial predictive framework.

4. **Historical Data Processing and EDA:**
   - Clean and explore the historical dataset, ensuring alignment with hindcast data in terms of temporal features.
   - Identify and incorporate additional relevant features for model testing.

5. **Model Testing and Iteration:**
   - Test the trained model on the historical dataset, evaluating its performance.
   - Iteratively refine the model based on testing outcomes, incorporating feedback and insights.
